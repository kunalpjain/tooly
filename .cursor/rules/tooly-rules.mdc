## Cursor Rule: Consistent Code and UI Style

- Always follow the **initial style** used in the project unless explicitly asked to change.
- Do **not introduce a different code style or UI layout pattern** in later components or updates.
- For example:
  - If we use functional React components with hooks (useState/useEffect), stick to it across all components.
  - If we use Tailwind utility-first styling with certain spacing (e.g., p-4, rounded-2xl), keep that consistent across the app.
  - If we define components with named folders and PascalCase files (`SmartConverter.tsx`), keep the structure uniform.
- Avoid mixing styling approaches (e.g., don’t switch between Tailwind and inline styles, or between Tailwind and CSS modules).
- Avoid overengineering or adding abstraction unless a pattern has already been established.
- Assume we are **a single developer team** and prioritize readability, simplicity, and consistency.

 Goal: Make sure every file in this repo feels like it’s written by the same person.

# 🚫 Temporary & Obsolete Code Cleanup Rule

During updates or debugging, developers may introduce temporary logic such as:

- `console.log`, `debugger` or print statements
- Hardcoded mock data or short-circuit return paths
- Duplicate or old versions of functions
- Commented-out or unused code blocks

These **must be removed before finalizing a code update**.

✅ When generating or modifying code, always:
- Remove any debug-related code (e.g., console logs, debugger)
- Remove unused mock data, hardcoded logic, or test scaffolding
- Delete all outdated or unused code blocks
- Ensure only *active*, production-ready logic remains in the final code

🚨 Do not retain commented-out legacy logic as reference — use Git history instead.

💡 Example:
```js
// ❌ Bad
console.log("DEBUG - raw input", input);

// ✅ Good
// (removed after confirming base64 decoding worked)
